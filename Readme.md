# Project Title: Stroke Prediction Analysis

## Description
This project, developed by Saikumar Soma, focuses on predicting stroke occurrences based on various health parameters. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter notebook (`Final_code.ipynb`) and a dataset (`healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv`).

## Files in the Repository

1. **Final_code.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the code and algorithms used for the stroke prediction analysis. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, training, and evaluation.

2. **healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv**: This CSV file is the dataset used for the analysis. It includes various health-related parameters that are considered potential indicators for stroke risk.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn (These can be installed using `pip install <library_name>`)

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Usage
1. Open the `Final_code.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Run the cells in sequence to perform the analysis.
